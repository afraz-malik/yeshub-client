`\n//                 Depending on the results of the market analysis, the identification and mobilization of the target group in Stages 1 to 3, the desired level of educational qualification and the design of the courses must be decided to be aligned with the qualification and certification frameworks. of government institutions . Various course possibilities can be considered, for example a mixed range of long and short courses leading to different levels of certification. Depending on the applicable qualification framework, both formal and non-formal training designs can be chosen that allow apprenticeship, work, work-apprenticeship, or other custom designs.\n\n//                 The FTP curriculum offering must be relevant and aligned with the needs of:\n\n//                 Young men and women\n//                 The private sector that hires program students in decent work jobs.\n//                 In addition, the participation of the private sector will be required in the development and validation of the curricula.\n\n//                 In curriculum development, an important aspect to consider is how to break gender stereotypes and gender discrimination in TVET. For this, it is important to work on sensitizing young men and women, as well as educators and future employers, and especially addressing the awareness of young women about their rights, gender stereotypes and power relations and stimulating their empowerment. In the planning and delivery of curricula, it is also important to allow the participation of young women in the design of educational programs and activities. In this sense, it is also important to pay attention to the stereotypes of other groups such as LGTB and ethnic minorities.\n\n//                 People who have an entrepreneurial profile, apart from being motivated, need to have a good level of self-esteem and empowerment (economic and social) to be able to face the risks and insecurity related to entrepreneurship. These factors are crucial to the success and sustainability of young people's business initiatives. Therefore, identifying the aptitude and talent for entrepreneurship  is the first step to be able to identify the people who can follow the path to entrepreneurship as the first choice of preference.\n\n//                 To awaken interest for entrepreneurship, a sample about what entrepreneurship is can be offered to FTP education students. The development curriculum for entrepreneurship requires content and suitable methodologies to prepare students to face the dynamics of the business world, to accept and manage risk and uncertainty related to entrepreneurship and to develop the ability to make decisions and leadership required for the business management. Curricula should include specific attention to female entrepreneurship to awaken the interest of women and equip them to face entrepreneurship-related challenges that are regularly greater than those faced by men.`,\n//           subContents: [],\n//         },\n//         tools: [\n//           {\n//             id: 1,\n//             shortTitle:\n//               'ILO_QualityApprenticeshipToolkit_I_Guide for Policy Makers_2017',\n//             tools: [\n//               {\n//                 id: 58,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original:\n//                   'ILO_QualityApprenticeshipToolkit_I_Guide for Policy Makers_2017.pdf',\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A19%3A45.875Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n//               },\n//               {\n//                 id: 59,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original:\n//                   'Manual de Herramientas de la OIT para Aprendizajes de Calidad_Vol I para Formuladores de politiccas_2017.pdf',\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A19%3A51.408Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n//               },\n//               {\n//                 id: 60,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original:\n//                   \"Outils pour des Apprentissages de Qualite_Vol I Guide de OIT a l'intention des decideurs politiques_2017.pdf\",\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A19%3A56.526Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n//               },\n//             ],\n//           },\n//           {\n//             id: 2,\n//             shortTitle:\n//               'Setting_the_agenda_the_girls_platform_for_action_Plan_2020',\n//             tools: [\n//               {\n//                 id: 61,\n//                 type: 'g',\n//                 original:\n//                   'Setting_the_agenda_the_girls_platform_for_action_Plan_2020 -

It can include transformative or gender-aware approaches or a combination of both. Strategies with a gender perspective (GM) must be specific with objectives, activities, budgets, etc. In addition, it is necessary to understand the definitions of gender, create a joint vision for gender equality and develop the appropriate strategy. This section contains some examples of methodologies frequently used in Latin America (see also section 1.3).\n\n//                     Gender mainstreaming is not only relevant in preparing for salaried employment but also for entrepreneurship, including in rural areas.

The budgets with a gender approach is developed based on gender analysis and defined strategy, and should be aimed at an equitable distribution of resources.

The actors involved are structured according to gender relations and norms in the surrounding society and (re) produce existing gender inequalities. Therefore, the gender mainstreaming strategy must include both actions at the programmatic level and at the internal institutional level. The latter must be implemented and monitored by each entity individually. Program activities are monitored globally.\n\n//                     The creation of public - private alliances or cooperation with multiple stakeholders ( multi-stakeholder cooperation) and the establishment of networks is essential to ensure the success of entrepreneurship and youth social innovation in Latin America and must be considered from the beginning when designing a YEE project. The management of gender transformative alliances must consider at least the following three areas, and must consider the gender sensitivity of:\n\n//                     Instances of FTP to ensure the quality of the training offer (FTP) with a gender transforming approach;\n//                     Government bodies to ensure coordination with other projects and compliance with State requirements and policies;\n//                     Private sector to ensure the relevance of the training offer (FTP) and other support activities for the employment of youth, as well as to ensure gender sensitive work environments.`,\n//           subContents: [\n//             `Gender-sensitive companies / institutions must be identified or, at a minimum, open to entering into a staff awareness and institutional strengthening process to develop the capacity to promote a gender-sensitive workplace or education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men. One way to convince companies is to make them understand that greater equality will translate into more profits and better business ( greater equality = better business). Having more diverse teams also results in improved performance. One factor may be that diverse teams bring together multiple perspectives, allowing for a more holistic analysis of problems encountered at work. In addition, companies open to greater diversity in their staff are more likely to take advantage of the talents available in different population groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, and so on.`,\n//             `Based on the development opportunities identified in the market scan and gender analysis, it is recommended to include in the design the management of alliances with companies in the region. On the one hand, to open spaces for articulation with production units that, due to their level of progress and consolidation, can be integrated into new markets, becoming providers of services, supplies of raw materials or products that allow increasing business opportunities. On the other hand, in relation to the employability component, to establish alliances for the employment of young people who will participate in the project. Specifically, conferences or business meetings can be sponsored for this purpose.`,\n//             `Every company and institution must have and implement a formal policy regarding gender equality, and include it in the reports on human resources. A gender-sensitive work policymust provide: A nondiscrimination clause; Equal opportunities with respect to hiring, remuneration, promotion, training; Quotas of women in decision-making positions; Maternity and paternity leave; Flexible work hours; Access to child care; Gender-sensitive facilities, such as separate bathrooms, breastfeeding spaces; Safety and health, including policies against sexual harassment and an objective professional person to speak to. However, more is needed than developing formal policies and rules regarding gender: awareness and skills of staff and management must be worked on so that they are truly implemented and respected.\n\n//                         The info-story on the gender gap in employment is recommended: what slows the advancement of women?

Plan the time and frequency of the trainings in order to allow young women with children to participate.\n//                     Secure transportation if possible or provide training on transportation security measures. In case of events (employment forums, youth leaders forum), rent transportation for participants.\n//                     Research and offer technical training on income generation options that produce added value or access to quality employment specifically for women.\n//                     Incorporate life skills training: self-esteem, empowerment, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, new masculinities and life project, which allow generating awareness in young people in terms of gender roles, and creating capacities in terms making decisions about your own life (see Stage 4).\n//                     Include psychosocial support in the project.\n//                     In areas of social violence, it is necessary to organize spaces for reflection among the young participants to face the conditions of violence and the identification of alternatives to face them.

One modality is to establish and develop mentoring mechanisms among young women and men themselves. This is called ' peer review ' ( peer review ). The exchange of experiences between young people in practice can be a very strong support for individual students in the process of recognizing and facing challenges and solving practical problems. Gender aspects in education and work should also be touched on in this peer review, either in pairs or in groups of the same gender or in mixed groups.\n\n//                     Another modality is the tutoring of students by their educators .

In the event that post-graduates do not continue their career in a work context (salaried employment) and opt for a career as an entrepreneur, this mentoring option by the employing company does not exist, but they can choose to continue the Peer review among entrepreneurs as colleagues and / or mentoring by external tutors may be considered. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises can be involved in orientation programs.`,\n//             `In the counseling and mentoring process, gender and age relationships inherently introduce a challenge of keeping a balance of power. On the one hand, taking advantage of the accumulated experience of female or male tutors / mentors is necessary to accompany the person with less experience. On the other hand, tutors / mentors must ensure that the person who receives their support, follows an empowerment process that allows them to assume responsibility in making their own decisions. An imbalance of power in mentoring and mentoring relationships can easily distort the results of these processes. That is why it is important to raise awareness and train tutors and mentors in handling aspects of power, gender and age, in the orientation and mentoring process (see also section 2.4).\n\n//                         In the selection of tutors / mentors, their sensitivity to gender issues must be taken into account , but also their gender itself, since the use of tutors / mentors (women) can generate trust among female students / interns / employers.`,\n//             `Another form of accompaniment is labor intermediation , which can be carried out by tutors or mentors, but also by other actors such as a public or private service. Intermediation may include the organization of job fairs or exchanges, the creation of a database on young people seeking employment and companies offering employment, or the direct establishment of contacts between young people and employers. Like mentoring and guidance, intermediation becomes more important in times of transition (for example, from school to technical training, from FTP to first job, from one job to another, but also at the time of having a job). son / daughter).`,\n//           ],\n//         },\n//         tools: [\n//           {\n//             id: 1,\n//             shortTitle: '4.5.1 Digital-Skills-Toolkit',\n//             tools: [\n//               {\n//                 id: 167,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original: 'Digital-Skills-Toolkit.pdf',\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A01.848Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf',\n//               },\n//             ],\n//           },\n//           {\n//             id: 2,\n//             shortTitle: '4.5.2  Programa de Mentoria',\n//             tools: [\n//               {\n//                 id: 168,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original: '4.5.2.1 Programa de Mentoria.pdf',\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A16.393Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n//               },\n//               {\n//                 id: 169,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original:\n//                   '4.5.2.5 Guia Orientacion Socio-ocupacional_docentes_Bogota_2018.pdf',\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A20.425Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n//               },\n//               {\n//                 id: 170,\n//                 type: 'none',\n//                 original:\n//                   '4.5.2.6 Secuencia Didactica Orientacion Socio-ocupacional_docentes_Min Edu Col_Dic 2015.pdf',\n//                 link:\n//                   'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A26.638Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n//               },\n//             ],\n//           },\n//           {\n//             id: 3,\n//             shortTitle:\n//               '4.5.3 Engaging employers in Apprenticeships opportunities -

During the preparation phase, this requires participatory methodologies for assessing gender sensitivity at private and public training institutes and other parties on the labour market at all levels of the value chain. \\n\n          \n          Look at the example of the Gender Action Learning System (GALS), which provides a practical methodology to do this gender analysis together with your target group, even if they have low educational levels. \\n\n          \n          The analysis of a value chain with a gender perspective is a methodology that describes the existing gender relations in a particular environment, ranging from the home, organization or company, to a larger scale of community, ethnic group or society. It helps you to organize and interpret information on gender relations in a systematic way and to clarify the importance of gender differences in achieving development objectives in a given value chain or labour market. Understanding gender dynamics that prevent women from participating in and benefiting from labour market opportunities will contribute to the success of your YEE project as well as to the overall development of the communities where your project takes place (see section 6.3 for tools on gender assessments in value chains). \\n\n\n          Don’t forget to also include an analysis of the mechanisms that include or exclude certain groups, such as the LGTBI+ community or ethnic minorities. \\n \n\n          To be able to do a gender analysis you need to collect data disaggregated by sex. Also during the analysis of the collected data, the results and perceptions must continuously be differentiated for women and men. Try to understand the differences, explain them and use this information to formulate adequate (differentiated) responses for your project. \\n\n\n          Sex-disaggregated data is data related to individuals that is collected, analysed and presented separately for men, women and non-binary. You can also disaggregate by age and other sociodemographic characteristics, such as ethnic origin, economic class or sexual identity, depending on the context where your project will take place. Collecting and analysing data disaggregated by sex and other characteristics can help you target those youth that really need it, improve implementation, and conduct a more effective monitoring and evaluation process (e.g. defining gender sensitive indicators to assess who benefits or not how and why. See Phase 9). \\n \n\n          A systematic process for collecting sex-disaggregated data should include asking gender questions as part of the research design, developing sex-disaggregated tools for the indicators of interest, collecting information from men and women, as well as analysing the data to understand the gender differences and similarities. You can use Plan International’s  YES!ME which is a gender sensitive online tool for the registration and monitoring of participants of YEE projects. Yes!Me is based on ILO methodology and contains several questions at different levels focused on understanding the situation, bias and challenges faced by youth, especially young women, to enter the labour market. \\n \n\n         To collect the information, select the most convenient places and times for young women as well as men. Don’t forget that much of women’s work is invisible and unpaid; try to identify and link them to visible and paid work. \n\n         Always start with questions that are easier for young women and men to build confidence before moving on to more sensitive and complex questions.`,\n          subContents: [\n            'The tools allow conducting gender analysis in the context of any value chain or labor market sector to generate knowledge and then use the results of the analysis to inform the development of a new YEE project.

Your YEE project can act as a catalyst for integration if you target those groups that have not had the same opportunities as others. This can be the NEET group: men and women who are not employed and not receiving education or vocational training. \\n\n          Special attention to girls and young women is key, since they might not be looking for work (and therefore will not show in the unemployment data) due to the obstacles they face, such as a lack of day care for their children, household responsibilities or being rejected beforehand based on their reproductive age. Other groups that are often left behind are the LGBTI+ community, people with a disability or indigenous youth. \\n\n          Once you defined your target group, make a mapping of other potential actors from the private, public and civic sectors such as:\n         -\tTechnical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions that offer (or could offer) the necessary curricula and training; \n         -\tCompanies that could hire people from your target group; \n         -\tPublic entities that have the responsibility of providing the regulatory framework and education or employment related public services; \n        -\tAcademic institutions that can conduct research on the sector with a gender perspective; \n        -\tNon-governmental, producers’, youth-led or community-based organizations that can mobilise and promote activities with the target population. \\n \n         The goal of this mapping is to identify strategic alliances that can be strengthened during the project in order to achieve sustainability of the project’s results after the project is finished (see also Phases 7 and 8). This means when you are looking for possible TVET institutions as allies, you should target those that will be serving the target population long after the project has finished. Make a gender assessment of their capacities to successfully train young people in the required vocational and technical skills that you identified in the market analysis. Define how the project can help to strengthen these institutions that are key for the sustainability of your project, such as knowledgeable teachers, adequate training facilities, useful equipment and training modules that fulfil market demands and reach also young women. \\n\n         Possible international strategic alliances could be established with:\n        -\tThe Inter-American Centre for Knowledge Development in Vocational Training (CINTERFOR) of the International Labour Organization (ILO).

Useful guidelines and resources to support this are presented in Phase 8. \n          `,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle:\n              'ILO_QualityApprenticeshipToolkit_I_Guide for Policy Makers_2017',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 58,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  'ILO_QualityApprenticeshipToolkit_I_Guide for Policy Makers_2017.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A19%3A45.875Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 59,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  'Manual de Herramientas de la OIT para Aprendizajes de Calidad_Vol I para Formuladores de politiccas_2017.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A19%3A51.408Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 60,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  \"Outils pour des Apprentissages de Qualite_Vol I Guide de OIT a l'intention des decideurs politiques_2017.pdf\",\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A19%3A56.526Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 2,\n            shortTitle:\n              'Setting_the_agenda_the_girls_platform_for_action_Plan_2020',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 61,\n                type: 'g',\n                original:\n                  'Setting_the_agenda_the_girls_platform_for_action_Plan_2020 -

The results of your labour market analysis as well as the identification and mobilisation of the target group and other actors (Phase 1 to 3) will be very helpful during this process. \\n\n\n          There is a wide range of possible courses you can offer. You will not only have to take decisions regarding the content but also regarding the length, level of formality, type of trainings (e.g. more theory, practice or both) and ways to conduct them (online vs face-to-face or a combination of both). Include your target group and potential future employers in the development and validation of the TVET curricula to make sure they align with their needs. \\n\n          \n          Specifically include young women, LGBT+ people and ethnic minorities in the curriculum development to avoid gender stereotyping and discrimination in TVET.

This requires not only identifying youth with the skills and talent for entrepreneurship, but also sharing practical examples with TVET students about setting up their own business as alternative for employment. \\n\n          \n          Crucial factors for the success and sustainability of young people's business initiatives are motivation, self-esteem and economic empowerment to be able to face the associated risks and insecurity. The curriculum should prepare students for the dynamics of the business world; to accept and manage risk and uncertainty related to entrepreneurship; and help them develop a growth mindset as well as decision-making and other leadership skills required for managing the business. \\n\n          \n          Curricula should include specific attention to female entrepreneurship to awake the interest of young women and equip them to face challenges that are regularly greater than those faced by men.`,\n          subContents: [\n            `The strategy with a gender transformative approach must have sufficient human and financial resources to be able to execute it.

The budgets with a gender approach is developed based on gender analysis and defined strategy, and should be aimed at an equitable distribution of resources. These resources refer to financial resources, material resources (computers, infrastructure) as well as human resources. The gender budget does not only mean a differentiated use by gender of certain funds but also focuses on the interaction of expenditures with other resources.`,\n            `Developing budgets with a gender approach refers to the process of conceiving, planning, approving, executing, monitoring, analyzing and auditing budgets in a gender-sensitive manner. It involves the analysis of the actual expenses and income (of the project, a company, FTP institution or other instance) in women and girls compared to the expenses in men and boys. It helps to decide how the objectives and strategies of the projects should be formulated and is a tool for the effective implementation of projects since it allows to verify if the assignments are in line with the objectives and strategies in order to obtain the desired impact.`,\n            `The specific budget or the proportion of the general budget of the FTP project / institution / company, which should be allocated to gender activities depends on the strategy developed.

included in a wide range of international human rights frameworks and standards, including ILO conventions on workers' rights and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW). You can include it in your YEE project by formulating a gender transformative strategy based on the gender analysis you conducted in Phase 1.`,\n        image: stage2,\n        content: {\n          mainContent: `Nowhere in today’s world are young women and young men treated equally. Only through a gender transformative approach will we be able to tackle this. Gender inequality affects us all but is particularly unfair to girls and women. Being a girl or a woman most often means being valued less, having fewer opportunities and less pay for the same job, and facing stronger barriers to rights and more gender-based violence than their male peers. Although boys and men often benefit from this inequality, they also experience a fair share of negative consequences. Society traditionally imposes strict expectations upon them, such as showing strength and hiding feelings. These expectations get in the way of building healthy relationships and often lead them to high-risk behaviours. \\n\n\n          Plan’s gender transformative approach aspires to change this reality. It tackles the root causes of gender inequality and reshapes unequal power relations. It focuses not only on providing equal opportunities and outcomes for all, but on removing the barriers that keep girls from achieving their full potential and exercising their rights. \\n\n          \n          To facilitate and articulate a clear vision of what and how to implement a gender transformative approach Plan has identified six essential elements which are interconnected and mutually reinforcing: \\n\n          1.\tIt is paramount to understand and address how gender norms influence children throughout their life-course, from birth to adulthood; \\n \n          2.\tWe need to strengthen girls’ and young women’s agency over the decisions that affect them, as well as to build their knowledge, confidence, skills and access to and control over resources; \\n\n          3.\tWe need to work with and support boys, young men and men to embrace positive masculinities and to promote gender equality, while also achieving meaningful results for them; \\n\n          4.\tWe need to consider girls, boys, young women and young men in all their diversity when identifying and responding to their needs and interests; \\n\n          5.\tWe need to both improve the conditions (daily needs) but most importantly focus our work in improving the social position (value or status) of girls and young women; \\n\n          6.\tTo ensure a sustainable outcome we need to foster an enabling environment (including with policies) where all stakeholders work together to support children and youth on their journey towards gender equality. \\n\n\n          Mainstreaming gender into your YEE project means integrating the needs and experiences of both women and men in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Your gender mainstreaming strategy should include specific objectives, activities, budgets, key actors and SMART indicators. This requires understanding the definitions of gender and creating a joint vision for gender equality. \\n\n\n          Gender mainstreaming is not only relevant for employment but also for entrepreneurship, including in rural areas. See section 6.3 for tools on incorporating a gender perspective in agricultural value chains, which you can use to support young people’s entrepreneurships or cooperatives in rural areas. \\n\n\n         Make sure you assign sufficient human and financial resources to be able to execute your gender transformative strategy. This requires developing the budget of your project (so called Gender budgeting) as well as those of TVET institutions, companies and other parties including budget to implement activities to address the aspects mentioned before. \\n\n\n        Central to gender budgeting, is the equitable distribution of all resources; financial resources, material resources (computers, infrastructure) and human resources. It involves the analysis of the actual expenses and income dedicated to women and a comparison to men. This tool allows you to verify if budget allocation is in line with the objectives and strategies. Budgets are often intertwined as you can develop gender-specific activities, but also make already planned activities more gender-sensitive (e.g., by setting a quota for women's participation). \\n\n\n        Don’t forget to use inclusive language in all your project documentation (from the proposal, theory of change and implementation strategy to progress reports and training curricula). For example, refer to police officer instead of policeman and flight attendant instead of stewardess.`,\n          subContents: [\n            `Gender-sensitive companies / institutions must be identified or, at a minimum, open to entering into a staff awareness and institutional strengthening process to develop the capacity to promote a gender-sensitive workplace or education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men. One way to convince companies is to make them understand that greater equality will translate into more profits and better business ( greater equality = better business). Having more diverse teams also results in improved performance. One factor may be that diverse teams bring together multiple perspectives, allowing for a more holistic analysis of problems encountered at work. In addition, companies open to greater diversity in their staff are more likely to take advantage of the talents available in different population groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, and so on.`,\n            `Based on the development opportunities identified in the market scan and gender analysis, it is recommended to include in the design the management of alliances with companies in the region. On the one hand, to open spaces for articulation with production units that, due to their level of progress and consolidation, can be integrated into new markets, becoming providers of services, supplies of raw materials or products that allow increasing business opportunities. On the other hand, in relation to the employability component, to establish alliances for the employment of young people who will participate in the project. Specifically, conferences or business meetings can be sponsored for this purpose.`,\n            `Every company and institution must have and implement a formal policy regarding gender equality, and include it in the reports on human resources. A gender-sensitive work policymust provide: A nondiscrimination clause; Equal opportunities with respect to hiring, remuneration, promotion, training; Quotas of women in decision-making positions; Maternity and paternity leave; Flexible work hours; Access to child care; Gender-sensitive facilities, such as separate bathrooms, breastfeeding spaces; Safety and health, including policies against sexual harassment and an objective professional person to speak to. However, more is needed than developing formal policies and rules regarding gender: awareness and skills of staff and management must be worked on so that they are truly implemented and respected.\n\n                        The info-story on the gender gap in employment is recommended: what slows the advancement of women? ( www.ilo.org/infostories/es-ES/Stories/Employment/barriers-women#global-gap ) as learning or to be used in awareness-raising work with potential employer companies and other key stakeholders.`,\n          ],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle: '2.4.1 Corporate Engagement -

You can start establishing these alliances from the beginning of your YEE project, using participatory methodologies to ensure that the different objectives and interests that each party may have will be part of the project. At the same time, these methodologies will help you to define the strengths and resources they can bring to the table. \\n\n\n          Any organisation has its own bias in relation to gender inequalities. Therefore, a gender perspective must also be integrated at the internal institutional level of involved parties. This can be achieved through gender policies, strategies, work tools, trainings, and other gender structures within public institutions, companies and other project partners. \\n\n          \n          For managing alliances with a gender lens, you can look at three sectors: \\n\n          -\tTVET institutions offering good quality trainings and equal opportunities for young women and men. \\n\n          -\tGovernment authorities for the coordination with other YEE projects and compliance with national legislation and policies on TVET and gender. \\n\n          -\tCompanies from the private sector to align TVET trainings and other youth employment support activities with their needs and to ensure gender sensitive work environments. \\n\n          \n          Try to identify gender-sensitive companies and institutions that are open to strengthening their capacities to promote workplaces and education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men. Build business cases with private sector partners to show how greater equality will translate into more profits and better business. Companies that are open to greater diversity in their staff are more likely to take advantage of the talents available in different gender, ethnicity or age groups. Moreover, diverse teams bring together multiple perspectives, allowing for a more holistic analysis of problems encountered at work. \\n\n          \n          See the Tools section for business case examples developed by Plan International together with private sector partners in Indonesia and the Philippines. \\n\n          \n          Use the information from your market scan and gender analysis to identify potential alliances with companies in the region that can offer a workplace or support entrepreneurship based on their experience in the market.

Schedule periodic communication moments with the participants to perceive their impression of the project, identify their needs and possible challenges they face. Keep records of the conversations and agreements that result from this accompaniment. Involve also the family and other people related to participants. If the family is aware of the project, commitments and benefits for their family member, the retention rate goes up. It also helps to locate the vocational training in a central place between 3 to 4 communities to facilitate participation of young men and women, and at the same time avoid too many people with the same competencies saturating the local market. Likewise, constant monitoring of youth participation must be carried out (see also Phase 9). \\n\n          \n          To better focus your retention strategies, you can do a gender-differentiated analysis to identify risks that affect young women and men differently. The following actions can help to improve participation of adolescent and young women in YEE projects: \\n\n          •\tInvolve and commit the young women’s families and partners in the sensitization process so that they provide the necessary support for her participation in the project. \\n\n          •\tOrganize focus groups with young women to understand the obstacles they face and define actions to facilitate their participation. \\n\n          •\tAddress the particular needs of young women with children, providing services like childcare, early stimulation and travel allowance.\\n\n          •\tChoose spaces where there are already childcare and other services for mothers and their babies present. \\n\n          •\tOrganize activities in daylight hours and at a short distance from the community. Plan the time and frequency of trainings in such a way that young women with children can participate. \\n\n          •\tMake sure safe transportation is available or provide training on transportation security measures. In case of events at other locations, rent transportation for participants. \\n\n          •\tIncorporate life skills training on self-esteem, empowerment, gender equality, sexual and reproductive health, different masculinities and life projects.

In many cases, women face greater barriers than men, both in their daily life and at work. Therefore, it is important to encourage boys and young men to engage in the redistribution of power in their personal lives and in public spheres. They can become advocates and catalysers of change for the achievement of gender equality and women’s rights. Plan International has the Champions of Change methodology to promote this. \\n\n\n          At the same time, it is necessary to work on the empowerment of girls and young women so that they too defend their rights and become agents of change. For this, they will have to know their rights; recognize their strengths and weaknesses; and develop their self-esteem so that they lose fear of speaking in public and begin to participate actively, solving problems and taking control over their own lives. In short, they have to learn to make decisions with autonomy and self-worth about aspects that affect their own life, and establish agency and power. \\n\n          \n          Empowerment is also the foundation of leadership. Once young women have developed the personal skills to be leaders in their own lives, they can also acquire the skills to be leaders at work. For this they need to be able to create a vision, develop strategies to achieve it, seek potential allies, and communicate with others. \\n\n          \n          Part of this process is that young people, especially women, know their rights; from sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR), to human, citizen and specific youth and women rights.

This is called peer review. Exchange experiences can be very helpful for individual students in their process of recognizing and facing challenges and solving practical problems in their personal lives or at work. This can include looking at gender issues in education and work, either in groups of the same gender or in mixed groups. \\n  \n          2)\tMentoring of students by their teachers. Effectiveness of this (and the next) modality can be increased by training educators in mentoring practices with a gender transformation approach. \\n\n          3)\tMentoring or coaching by supervisors from the companies where students do their internships or actual employment after graduation. When graduates opt for a career as entrepreneur, they can choose to continue the peer review or look for an external mentor (for example, staff from a business association). Small and medium-sized enterprises can also be involved in orientation programs. \\n\n          In the coaching and mentoring process, differences in gender and age inherently introduce the challenge to maintain a power balance. On the one hand, the idea is for male or female coaches and mentors to use their accumulated experience when accompanying the student who has less experience. On the other hand, students who receive guidance should be able to follow their own empowerment process, which allows them to take responsibility in making their own decisions. \\n\n          \n          An imbalance of power in coaching and mentoring relationships can easily distort the results of these processes. That is why it is important to raise awareness and train coaches and mentors in handling aspects of power, gender and age during the given guidance. When selecting coaches and mentors, look at their gender sensitivity, but also at their gender identity, since the use of same gender coaches or mentors can generate trust among the students, specifically in the case of women. \\n\n          \n          Another form of guidance is labour intermediation, which can be carried out by coaches or mentors, but also by other actors such as a public or private service provider. Intermediation may include the organization of job fairs, practical exchanges, the creation of a demand – supply database (e.g. young people seeking and companies offering employment), or establishing a direct contact between young people and employers. Intermediation becomes more important in times of transition (for example, from school to technical training, from TVET to first job, from one job to another, or when becoming a parent).`,\n          subContents: [\n            `The guidance and mentoring by supervisors are important instruments for vocational training and empowerment of individuals and post-graduate students during their practices and internships, as well as in the context of employment. In the event that post-graduates do not continue their career in a work context (salaried employment) and opt for a career as an entrepreneur, this mentoring option by the employing company does not exist, but they can choose to continue the Peer review among entrepreneurs as colleagues and / or mentoring by external tutors may be considered. In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises can be involved in orientation programs.`,\n            `In the counseling and mentoring process, gender and age relationships inherently introduce a challenge of keeping a balance of power.

An imbalance of power in mentoring and mentoring relationships can easily distort the results of these processes.

While all entrepreneurs face significant challenges, women entrepreneurs face higher structural barriers as a result of discriminatory gender norms, high burden of unpaid care, less access to productive assets, fewer opportunities to develop relevant skills, restrictions on access to financing, lack of business networks and mentors, as well as gender-blind policies, laws and regulations. These barriers jeopardise women’s ability to start and grow companies and therefore limit their ability to act as agents of change in their communities. Business development centres should offer specific support and accompaniment for women to overcome additional barriers they face and ensure they can enter the business and labour market well prepared and empowered.\n\nPlan International has developed EntrepreNerd 2.0 which is a simulation game through which players are equipped, step by step, with the necessary skills to set up a small business.

Therefore, it is important to identify specific possibilities to strengthen the position of women in the management and development of value or supply chains.`,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle:\n              '6.4.1 Do agricultural development projects reach, benefit or empower women',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 234,\n                type: 'g',\n                original:\n                  '6.4.1.2 Do agricultural development projects reach, benefit or empower women - G.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A45%3A02.283Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 235,\n                type: 'g',\n                original:\n                  '6.4.1.4 Toolbox Promoting equal participation in sustainable economic development - GIZ - G.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A45%3A09.005Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 2,\n            shortTitle:\n              '6.4.2 Extracting Equality - Gender equality in extractive industries guidelines',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 236,\n                type: 'gp',\n                original:\n                  '6.4.2.1 Extracting Equality - Gender equality in extractive industries guidelines - G & P.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A45%3A16.379Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 237,\n                type: 'gp',\n                original:\n                  '6.4.2.2 The power of procurement - How to source from women-owned businesses - UN Women - G & P.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A45%3A20.784Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 238,\n                type: 'gp',\n                original:\n                  '6.4.2.3 Women in Agribusiness Report - IFC - G & P.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A45%3A24.983Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        id: 5,\n        title: `Financial management`,\n        description: `A key aspect for successful entrepreneurship and business development is access to capital and good financial management.`,\n        image: stage6,\n        content: {\n          mainContent: `A first step in financial management is to identify the possibilities and mechanisms to obtain access to seed capital and credit to start a company. This is specifically relevant for young people starting their first entrepreneurial experience. Subsequently there is a need for credit to grow the business and to finance recurring costs (such as to hold stocks or buy agricultural inputs). This requires the ability to prepare loan applications at banks and microfinance institutions. Once financing has been received, good record keeping of income and expenses is key to make sure the loan will be repaid on time and to avoid an accumulation of the loan costs (e.g. interest payments).\n\n          According to various studies, women are generally more efficient and reliable in managing investments, loans and paying their debts. This may be a reason to focus on preparing women in the financial aspects of business management, as the effect on the sustainability and profitability of businesses can be very strong. At the same time, one must not forget to train men in financial matters to enable them to acquire the necessary financial management skills as well.\n          \n          When making investments in the company, both men and women need to understand the concept of depreciation (i.e. equipment losing its value over time) and be able to apply it in their financial management to ensure the renewal of these investments at the appropriate times.          \n                    `,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle: '4.5.1 Digital-Skills-Toolkit',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 167,\n                type: 'none',\n                original: 'Digital-Skills-Toolkit.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A01.848Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 2,\n            shortTitle: '4.5.2  Programa de Mentoria',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 168,\n                type: 'none',\n                original: '4.5.2.1 Programa de Mentoria.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A16.393Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 169,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '4.5.2.5 Guia Orientacion Socio-ocupacional_docentes_Bogota_2018.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A20.425Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 170,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '4.5.2.6 Secuencia Didactica Orientacion Socio-ocupacional_docentes_Min Edu Col_Dic 2015.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A33%3A26.638Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 3,\n            shortTitle:\n              '4.5.3 Engaging employers in Apprenticeships opportunities -

These are businesses with a social or environmental mission, whose profit also benefits society. Businesses established by young people are often a type of social enterprises and they also look for cooperation with others in co-working or co-creation spaces. Like this they can jointly develop innovative initiatives for raising awareness, advocacy and lobby on socially important topics. They can exchange new technologies and achieve economies of scales in their operations, thus creating big social impact with small investments. `,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle:\n              '6.6.1 Challenge-Fund-for-Youth-Employment-Uganda-Scoping-Report_2019',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 239,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '6.6 Challenge-Fund-for-Youth-Employment-Uganda-Scoping-Report_2019.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A45%3A54.077Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 240,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '6.6 Financial_management_practices_in_successful_Small.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A46%3A00.828Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 241,\n                type: 'none',\n                original: '6.6 Funding women entrepreneurs_EIB_2020.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A46%3A04.926Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 242,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '6.6 LaGestionFInancieraylacompetitividadPYME_2017.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A46%3A18.648Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 243,\n                type: 'none',\n                original: '6.6 Manual Gestion financiera para PYMES.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A46%3A24.793Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 2,\n            shortTitle: '6.6.2 Invest in Women - IFC',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 244,\n                type: 'g',\n                original: '6.6.1.1 Invest in Women - IFC - G.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A46%3A33.396Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 3,\n            shortTitle:\n              '6.6.3 Determinants for financial inclusion of youth entrepreneurs_PEP_2020',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 245,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '6.6.2.3 Determinants for financial inclusion of youth entrepreneurs_PEP_2020.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A46%3A41.384Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        id: 7,\n        title: 'Examples and good practices',\n        description:\n          'In this section you can find a variety of project documents and practical experiences that can serve as inspiration for your youth economic empowerment initiatives.

As such they can become important instruments for providing accompaniment to graduates on the long term and to evaluate the true impact of your project after 10 years or even more.\n          \n          While YEE organizations and TVET institutes can offer spaces and physical instruments for alumni networks to carry out their activities, the management and coordination of the networks should be the responsibility of the alumni, preferably based on volunteerism.`,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle:\n              '7.2.1 International Youth Foundation 2025-Strategy-Brochure_2020',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 254,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '7.2.1a International Youth Foundation 2025-Strategy-Brochure_2020.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A47%3A53.301Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 255,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '7.2.1b International Youth Foundation_Transformation-2022_IYF-Strategy-SP.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A48%3A05.162Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 256,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '7.2.1c International Youth Foundation_Transformation-2022_IYF-Strategy-PO.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A48%3A19.291Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n              {\n                id: 257,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '7.2.1d International Youth Foundation_Transformation-2022_IYF-Strategy-FR.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A48%3A32.068Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 2,\n            shortTitle:\n              '7.2.2 How to Plan Successful Alumni Events for Greater Engagement',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 258,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '7.2.3 How to Plan Successful Alumni Events for Greater Engagement.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A48%3A48.266Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        id: 3,\n        title: 'Expansion of networks and alliances',\n        description:\n          'Graduates can serve as a vehicle for expanding contacts and relationships with new companies and organizations.',\n        image: stage7,\n        content: {\n          mainContent: `TVET institutes should constantly look for possibilities to expand their network and partnerships with companies, governmental institutions and civil organizations.

It is one thing to form alliances, another to make them strong enough to last after the project has finished. The more time you have to strengthen the partnerships initiated in the framework of your project, the stronger they will be upon project completion and the more chance you have that the initiated process will continue. \n          Strategic alliances must be established with all key actors from the public, private and civic sectors, through public-private partnerships. Already in Phases 1 and 2 we demonstrated the importance of identifying the possibilities to establish strategic alliances. In this final phase of your YEE project, these alliances must be strong enough to guarantee the continuity and replication of your initiatives. When you work closely together with public and private partners during project implementation, they can acquire the necessary experience and knowledge for the development of new policies and projects to promote the successful entry of young men and women on the market of employment and entrepreneurship. \n          Partnerships with the private sector are key to ensure that TVET curricula align with the requirements of the labour market. This should include a gender equality focus to facilitate access and retention of young women in skills development, employment and entrepreneurship.

Recollecting information can be done with different tools such as:\n\n          A.\tCharacterization and registration form: collects in a standardized way the basic information of each participant through a list of questions during registration. This is the baseline of your YEE project (see also Phase 1). The form can also be used to select the target group of the project (see also section 3.2).\n          B.\tYouth monitoring survey: aims to collect information from each participant to measure their performance in relation to the indicators of the project. \n          C.\tPartner monitoring survey: aims to collect information on project performance indicators through questionnaires for partnering entities (TVET centres, companies and public institutions that provide training, (self) employment services, jobs, apprenticeship or internships for young people). \n          D.\tSatisfaction interviews or focus group discussions with participants and partners: aim to explore the satisfaction and perceptions of the different project parties through an individual or group interview or focus group, which complement the monitoring surveys with more qualitative data on the project’s intervention to provide feedback and improve it. \n          E.\tMonitoring system and systematisation matrixes: you can organize the above tools in separate matrixes that facilitate analysis and insertion into the monitoring system. The monitoring system will provide an overview of the status of each of the main indicators of your project at the moment of collection and compare them to their status at the start of the project (baseline, see Phase 1). \n          F.\tAction Learning: is a process that involves a small group working on real problems, taking action, and learning as individuals, as a team, and as an organization. It helps organizations develop creative, flexible and successful strategies to pressing problems. For more information see World Institute for Action Learning.\n          G.\tExternal evaluation: consists of the collection, systematisation, analysis and reporting of data related to the achievements of the project’s Theory of Change (see Phase 2) by a specialized agency that has not been involved with the project previously. Often the following OECD DAC criteria are evaluated: relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, impact and sustainability.\n          \n          Before interviewing minors don’t forget to have their guardians sign an informed consent form to get formal authorization. Also explain to the minors themselves what the collected information will be used for and let them know they can withdraw at any time if they don’t want to be interviewed anymore. Be aware to have safeguarding guidelines in place to guarantee a safe environment for youth’s participation and in particular for young women.\n          \n          When designing indicators, important to have clear how the information will be collected. To ensure that the indicators are objectively verifiable they have to be SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant and Time bound). \n          \n          Here are some additional tips for the M&E process:\n          \tClearly define the output, outcome, and impact indicators according to the project’s Theory of Change. \n          Indicate for each indicator the target group (disaggregated by gender, age and other relevant characteristics), source of information, actor responsible for collecting the information, measurement frequency, and observations on data quality. \n          Develop a user-friendly information management system that allows standardizing and optimizing the procedures for measuring, storing and managing the information of the different project indicators. \n          Include an M&E office in your budget or hire an expert on monitoring and evaluation to manage the whole process. \n          Define a procedure for permanent control of the monitoring information in alliance with project partners such as vocational training institutes. \n          Differentiate all questions and information by gender to capture differences in the performance of women, men and other genders \n          \n          Plan has developed YES!ME, a digital monitoring system for the registration and follow-up of the participants of a YEE project. The system can monitor young people for up to 6 years after their participation in the project. Similarly, the system collects information to measure the impact of the project at the individual level as well as collectively.\n          \n          `,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle:\n              '9.1.1 Guide on Measuring Decent Jobs for Youth_M&E_ILO',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 290,\n                type: 'none',\n                original:\n                  '9.1.7.3 Guide on Measuring Decent Jobs for Youth_M&E_ILO.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A52%3A56.836Z0-homepage+-+Best+Practices+Guidelines+and+Toolkit+on+Engaging+the+Private+Sector+in+Skills+Development+-+P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n        ],\n      },\n      {\n        id: 2,\n        title: `M&E with a gender focus`,\n        description: `Monitoring and evaluation with a gender perspective aims to evaluate the intentional and unintentional effects of the YEE project on gender relations and the empowerment of women. `,\n        image: stage9,\n        content: {\n          mainContent: `Gender should be addressed in ongoing monitoring and during periodic evaluations for the same reasons that we address other issues: when assessing whether an activity is achieving its objectives, we can consider what has been achieved and what can be learned for future efforts. If results are not evaluated in terms of gender strategies and interventions, the latter are unlikely to receive attention during project implementation.\n\n          Gender-sensitive M&E in a results-based framework reveals the extent to which the project has achieved improvements in the social and economic well-being of women and men. It also helps improve project performance during implementation by facilitating mid-term adjustments and helps draw lessons for future projects, for example by detecting and addressing gender-based constraints.\n          \n          Gender-sensitive M&E should not only collect gender data, but also analyse the underlying causes of gender differences and implement actions to achieve gender equity. Interventions aimed at empowering women or other groups, without considering the people in their environment (at work, but also at home or in the community) and the gender relations between them, can fail. Gender-sensitive M&E can identify unintended consequences of the project as well as opportunities for empowerment of specific youth groups. By demonstrating the effects of interventions for both women and men, this data can be used to adjust project implementation towards a more equitable development, benefiting young people of all genders, age groups and ethnicities. \n          \n          In order to conduct gender-sensitive monitoring and evaluation, sex-disaggregated data is required and must be collected continuously (see Phase 1).\n          \n          Gender should be included from the beginning of the project and in the design of the monitoring plan or system. If a monitoring framework already exists (such as a logical framework or theory of change), a gender focus should be integrated. This involves reviewing all indicators, targets, results, data collection methods, etcetera on their gender responsiveness and adding gender-sensitive indicators, results, and methods if necessary. Ideally, this is done in an integrated way, from the start of a project. If gender has not been taken into account at the project design phase, it will most likely not be taken into account during implementation either. \n          \n          Institutional structures and guidelines are needed to support good gender oversight at the national, local and project levels. Train project staff and other parties on how to make specific and adequate references to gender in supervision forms, progress reports, and other project related documents. Although a gender expert should be included in the M&E team, s/he cannot be solely responsible for this. \n          \n          These indicators should be gender-sensitive, not only those at output and outcome, but, most of all, those at impact level. In other words, they should not focus only on the number of women participating in training and employment, but also pay attention to the intensity, content and remuneration of their participation. Pay attention to the real benefits for women in terms of social and economic empowerment, and in reducing gender-based inequalities. \n          `,\n          subContents: [],\n        },\n        tools: [\n          {\n            id: 1,\n            shortTitle:\n              '9.2.1 Measuring Womens Econ Emp_FINAL_2015_UN Foundation',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 291,\n                type: 'g',\n                original:\n                  '9.2.0 Measuring Womens Econ Emp_FINAL_2015_UN Foundation - G.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A53%3A12.099Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 2,\n            shortTitle:\n              '9.2.2 Lessons in Theory of Change - Gender and Inclusion',\n            tools: [\n              {\n                id: 292,\n                type: 'g',\n                original:\n                  '9.2.1.3 Lessons in Theory of Change - Gender and Inclusion - G.pdf',\n                link:\n                  'https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A53%3A18.251Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf',\n              },\n            ],\n          },\n          {\n            id: 3,\n            shortTitle:\n              '9.2.3 Measuring gender-transformative change.
