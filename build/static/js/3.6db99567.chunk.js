During the preparation phase, this requires participatory methodologies for assessing gender sensitivity at private and public training institutes and other parties on the labour market at all levels of the value chain. \n\n          \n          Look at the example of the Gender Action Learning System (GALS), which provides a practical methodology to do this gender analysis together with your target group, even if they have low educational levels. \n\n          \n          The analysis of a value chain with a gender perspective is a methodology that describes the existing gender relations in a particular environment, ranging from the home, organization or company, to a larger scale of community, ethnic group or society. It helps you to organize and interpret information on gender relations in a systematic way and to clarify the importance of gender differences in achieving development objectives in a given value chain or labour market. Understanding gender dynamics that prevent women from participating in and benefiting from labour market opportunities will contribute to the success of your YEE project as well as to the overall development of the communities where your project takes place (see section 6.3 for tools on gender assessments in value chains). \n\n\n          Don\u2019t forget to also include an analysis of the mechanisms that include or exclude certain groups, such as the LGTBI+ community or ethnic minorities. \n \n\n          To be able to do a gender analysis you need to collect data disaggregated by sex. Also during the analysis of the collected data, the results and perceptions must continuously be differentiated for women and men. Try to understand the differences, explain them and use this information to formulate adequate (differentiated) responses for your project. \n\n\n          Sex-disaggregated data is data related to individuals that is collected, analysed and presented separately for men, women and non-binary. You can also disaggregate by age and other sociodemographic characteristics, such as ethnic origin, economic class or sexual identity, depending on the context where your project will take place. Collecting and analysing data disaggregated by sex and other characteristics can help you target those youth that really need it, improve implementation, and conduct a more effective monitoring and evaluation process (e.g. defining gender sensitive indicators to assess who benefits or not how and why. See Phase 9). \n \n\n          A systematic process for collecting sex-disaggregated data should include asking gender questions as part of the research design, developing sex-disaggregated tools for the indicators of interest, collecting information from men and women, as well as analysing the data to understand the gender differences and similarities. You can use Plan International\u2019s  YES!ME which is a gender sensitive online tool for the registration and monitoring of participants of YEE projects. Yes!Me is based on ILO methodology and contains several questions at different levels focused on understanding the situation, bias and challenges faced by youth, especially young women, to enter the labour market. \n \n\n         To collect the information, select the most convenient places and times for young women as well as men. Don\u2019t forget that much of women\u2019s work is invisible and unpaid; try to identify and link them to visible and paid work. \n\n         Always start with questions that are easier for young women and men to build confidence before moving on to more sensitive and complex questions.",subContents:["The tools allow conducting gender analysis in the context of any value chain or labor market sector to generate knowledge and then use the results of the analysis to inform the development of a new YEE project.

These resources refer to financial resources, material resources (computers, infrastructure) as well as human resources. The gender budget does not only mean a differentiated use by gender of certain funds but also focuses on the interaction of expenditures with other resources.","Developing budgets with a gender approach refers to the process of conceiving, planning, approving, executing, monitoring, analyzing and auditing budgets in a gender-sensitive manner. It involves the analysis of the actual expenses and income (of the project, a company, FTP institution or other instance) in women and girls compared to the expenses in men and boys. It helps to decide how the objectives and strategies of the projects should be formulated and is a tool for the effective implementation of projects since it allows to verify if the assignments are in line with the objectives and strategies in order to obtain the desired impact.","The specific budget or the proportion of the general budget of the FTP project / institution / company, which should be allocated to gender activities depends on the strategy developed. Furthermore, budgets are often intertwined, as not only will gender-specific activities be developed, but already planned activities can also be made more gender-sensitive (for example, by setting a quota for women's participation)."]},tools:[{id:1,shortTitle:"2.3.1 Women Economic Empowerment_CGD_2016",tools:[{id:71,type:"g",original:"2.3.0 -

Only through a gender transformative approach will we be able to tackle this. Gender inequality affects us all but is particularly unfair to girls and women. Being a girl or a woman most often means being valued less, having fewer opportunities and less pay for the same job, and facing stronger barriers to rights and more gender-based violence than their male peers. Although boys and men often benefit from this inequality, they also experience a fair share of negative consequences. Society traditionally imposes strict expectations upon them, such as showing strength and hiding feelings. These expectations get in the way of building healthy relationships and often lead them to high-risk behaviours. \n\n\n          Plan\u2019s gender transformative approach aspires to change this reality.

It focuses not only on providing equal opportunities and outcomes for all, but on removing the barriers that keep girls from achieving their full potential and exercising their rights. \n\n          \n          To facilitate and articulate a clear vision of what and how to implement a gender transformative approach Plan has identified six essential elements which are interconnected and mutually reinforcing: \n\n          1.\tIt is paramount to understand and address how gender norms influence children throughout their life-course, from birth to adulthood; \n \n          2.\tWe need to strengthen girls\u2019 and young women\u2019s agency over the decisions that affect them, as well as to build their knowledge, confidence, skills and access to and control over resources; \n\n          3.\tWe need to work with and support boys, young men and men to embrace positive masculinities and to promote gender equality, while also achieving meaningful results for them; \n\n          4.\tWe need to consider girls, boys, young women and young men in all their diversity when identifying and responding to their needs and interests; \n\n          5.\tWe need to both improve the conditions (daily needs) but most importantly focus our work in improving the social position (value or status) of girls and young women; \n\n          6.\tTo ensure a sustainable outcome we need to foster an enabling environment (including with policies) where all stakeholders work together to support children and youth on their journey towards gender equality. \n\n\n          Mainstreaming gender into your YEE project means integrating the needs and experiences of both women and men in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Your gender mainstreaming strategy should include specific objectives, activities, budgets, key actors and SMART indicators. This requires understanding the definitions of gender and creating a joint vision for gender equality. \n\n\n          Gender mainstreaming is not only relevant for employment but also for entrepreneurship, including in rural areas. See section 6.3 for tools on incorporating a gender perspective in agricultural value chains, which you can use to support young people\u2019s entrepreneurships or cooperatives in rural areas. \n\n\n         Make sure you assign sufficient human and financial resources to be able to execute your gender transformative strategy. This requires developing the budget of your project (so called Gender budgeting) as well as those of TVET institutions, companies and other parties including budget to implement activities to address the aspects mentioned before. \n\n\n        Central to gender budgeting, is the equitable distribution of all resources; financial resources, material resources (computers, infrastructure) and human resources. It involves the analysis of the actual expenses and income dedicated to women and a comparison to men. This tool allows you to verify if budget allocation is in line with the objectives and strategies. Budgets are often intertwined as you can develop gender-specific activities, but also make already planned activities more gender-sensitive (e.g., by setting a quota for women's participation). \n\n\n        Don\u2019t forget to use inclusive language in all your project documentation (from the proposal, theory of change and implementation strategy to progress reports and training curricula). For example, refer to police officer instead of policeman and flight attendant instead of stewardess.",subContents:["Gender-sensitive companies / institutions must be identified or, at a minimum, open to entering into a staff awareness and institutional strengthening process to develop the capacity to promote a gender-sensitive workplace or education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men. One way to convince companies is to make them understand that greater equality will translate into more profits and better business ( greater equality = better business). Having more diverse teams also results in improved performance. One factor may be that diverse teams bring together multiple perspectives, allowing for a more holistic analysis of problems encountered at work. In addition, companies open to greater diversity in their staff are more likely to take advantage of the talents available in different population groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, age, and so on.","Based on the development opportunities identified in the market scan and gender analysis, it is recommended to include in the design the management of alliances with companies in the region. On the one hand, to open spaces for articulation with production units that, due to their level of progress and consolidation, can be integrated into new markets, becoming providers of services, supplies of raw materials or products that allow increasing business opportunities. On the other hand, in relation to the employability component, to establish alliances for the employment of young people who will participate in the project. Specifically, conferences or business meetings can be sponsored for this purpose.","Every company and institution must have and implement a formal policy regarding gender equality, and include it in the reports on human resources.

You can start establishing these alliances from the beginning of your YEE project, using participatory methodologies to ensure that the different objectives and interests that each party may have will be part of the project. At the same time, these methodologies will help you to define the strengths and resources they can bring to the table. \n\n\n          Any organisation has its own bias in relation to gender inequalities. Therefore, a gender perspective must also be integrated at the internal institutional level of involved parties. This can be achieved through gender policies, strategies, work tools, trainings, and other gender structures within public institutions, companies and other project partners. \n\n          \n          For managing alliances with a gender lens, you can look at three sectors: \n\n          -\tTVET institutions offering good quality trainings and equal opportunities for young women and men. \n\n          -\tGovernment authorities for the coordination with other YEE projects and compliance with national legislation and policies on TVET and gender. \n\n          -\tCompanies from the private sector to align TVET trainings and other youth employment support activities with their needs and to ensure gender sensitive work environments. \n\n          \n          Try to identify gender-sensitive companies and institutions that are open to strengthening their capacities to promote workplaces and education with equal opportunities and benefits for women and men.

You can use different strategies for the retention of youth. \n\n\n          One of the main ways to prevent desertion is the accompaniment of project participants. Schedule periodic communication moments with the participants to perceive their impression of the project, identify their needs and possible challenges they face. Keep records of the conversations and agreements that result from this accompaniment. Involve also the family and other people related to participants. If the family is aware of the project, commitments and benefits for their family member, the retention rate goes up. It also helps to locate the vocational training in a central place between 3 to 4 communities to facilitate participation of young men and women, and at the same time avoid too many people with the same competencies saturating the local market. Likewise, constant monitoring of youth participation must be carried out (see also Phase 9). \n\n          \n          To better focus your retention strategies, you can do a gender-differentiated analysis to identify risks that affect young women and men differently. The following actions can help to improve participation of adolescent and young women in YEE projects: \n\n          \u2022\tInvolve and commit the young women\u2019s families and partners in the sensitization process so that they provide the necessary support for her participation in the project. \n\n          \u2022\tOrganize focus groups with young women to understand the obstacles they face and define actions to facilitate their participation. \n\n          \u2022\tAddress the particular needs of young women with children, providing services like childcare, early stimulation and travel allowance.\n\n          \u2022\tChoose spaces where there are already childcare and other services for mothers and their babies present. \n\n          \u2022\tOrganize activities in daylight hours and at a short distance from the community.

For this, they will have to know their rights; recognize their strengths and weaknesses; and develop their self-esteem so that they lose fear of speaking in public and begin to participate actively, solving problems and taking control over their own lives.

On the one hand, the idea is for male or female coaches and mentors to use their accumulated experience when accompanying the student who has less experience.

Intermediation may include the organization of job fairs, practical exchanges, the creation of a demand \u2013 supply database (e.g. young people seeking and companies offering employment), or establishing a direct contact between young people and employers.

It helps organizations develop creative, flexible and successful strategies to pressing problems. For more information see World Institute for Action Learning.\n          G.\tExternal evaluation: consists of the collection, systematisation, analysis and reporting of data related to the achievements of the project\u2019s Theory of Change (see Phase 2) by a specialized agency that has not been involved with the project previously.

It also helps improve project performance during implementation by facilitating mid-term adjustments and helps draw lessons for future projects, for example by detecting and addressing gender-based constraints.\n          \n          Gender-sensitive M&E should not only collect gender data, but also analyse the underlying causes of gender differences and implement actions to achieve gender equity. Interventions aimed at empowering women or other groups, without considering the people in their environment (at work, but also at home or in the community) and the gender relations between them, can fail. Gender-sensitive M&E can identify unintended consequences of the project as well as opportunities for empowerment of specific youth groups. By demonstrating the effects of interventions for both women and men, this data can be used to adjust project implementation towards a more equitable development, benefiting young people of all genders, age groups and ethnicities. \n          \n          In order to conduct gender-sensitive monitoring and evaluation, sex-disaggregated data is required and must be collected continuously (see Phase 1).\n          \n          Gender should be included from the beginning of the project and in the design of the monitoring plan or system. If a monitoring framework already exists (such as a logical framework or theory of change), a gender focus should be integrated. This involves reviewing all indicators, targets, results, data collection methods, etcetera on their gender responsiveness and adding gender-sensitive indicators, results, and methods if necessary. Ideally, this is done in an integrated way, from the start of a project. If gender has not been taken into account at the project design phase, it will most likely not be taken into account during implementation either. \n          \n          Institutional structures and guidelines are needed to support good gender oversight at the national, local and project levels. Train project staff and other parties on how to make specific and adequate references to gender in supervision forms, progress reports, and other project related documents. Although a gender expert should be included in the M&E team, s/he cannot be solely responsible for this. \n          \n          These indicators should be gender-sensitive, not only those at output and outcome, but, most of all, those at impact level. In other words, they should not focus only on the number of women participating in training and employment, but also pay attention to the intensity, content and remuneration of their participation. Pay attention to the real benefits for women in terms of social and economic empowerment, and in reducing gender-based inequalities. \n          ",subContents:[]},tools:[{id:1,shortTitle:"9.2.1 Measuring Womens Econ Emp_FINAL_2015_UN Foundation",tools:[{id:291,type:"g",original:"9.2.0 Measuring Womens Econ Emp_FINAL_2015_UN Foundation - G.pdf",link:"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A53%3A12.099Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf"}]},{id:2,shortTitle:"9.2.2 Lessons in Theory of Change - Gender and Inclusion",tools:[{id:292,type:"g",original:"9.2.1.3 Lessons in Theory of Change - Gender and Inclusion - G.pdf",link:"https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/static.hub/2021-08-05T12%3A53%3A18.251Z0-homepage%20-%20Best%20Practices%20Guidelines%20and%20Toolkit%20on%20Engaging%20the%20Private%20Sector%20in%20Skills%20Development%20-%20P.pdf"}]},{id:3,shortTitle:"9.2.3 Measuring gender-transformative change.
